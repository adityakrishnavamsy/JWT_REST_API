# JWT_REST_API

When two computers are connected via HTTPS, it is secure to communicate a JWT, which is a string of characters encoded, between them. The token stands for a value that can only be accessed by a computer that has knowledge of the secret key used to encrypt it.
Token-based authentication will be added to an already-existing REST API in this case. JWT is the authentication method in question (JSON Web Token). It's okay if that doesn't provide much information. When I first heard the phrase, it also seemed unusual to me.
